# Oracle Service Runbook

Operational guide for the Tikka randomness oracle service.

## First-Run Setup

The oracle service is deployed via `docker-compose.yml` from the repository root. Before starting, prepare your environment:

### 1. Create environment file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate with your production credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with:
# - ORACLE_SECRET_KEY: Ed25519 secret key (S... format or 32-byte hex/base64)
# - STELLAR_RPC_URL: Soroban RPC endpoint
# - FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID: Raffle factory contract address
# - Optional: ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL for operational alerts
```

### 2. Start the service

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Docker Compose will:

- Build the oracle service from `oracle/Dockerfile`
- Mount a persistent volume at `/usr/src/app/data` for checkpoint and dedup state
- Publish `/health` on host loopback at port 9090 for local probes
- Keep `/metrics` on a separate, un-published container port (9091 by default)
- Apply resource limits (512 MB memory, 1 CPU) to prevent runaway consumption
- Rotate logs to prevent unbounded growth

### 3. Verify startup

```bash
# Check service is running
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f oracle

# Check health endpoint (returns {"status":"ok"})
curl http://localhost:9090/health

# View metrics (Prometheus text format)
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### 4. Local development

For development, copy `docker-compose.override.yml.example` to `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
```

This disables production resource limits and enables debug logging without modifying the committed compose file.

## Data Persistence

The oracle service maintains two critical files in the `/data` volume:

### checkpoint.json

**Purpose:** Tracks the last successfully processed ledger number  
**Size:** ~100 bytes  
**Persistence:** Must survive container restarts to avoid event gaps  
**Loss impact:** If lost, the oracle resumes from the current ledger and misses any `RandomnessRequested` events that occurred while it was down. Fallback: the raffle will timeout on-chain after `ORACLE_TIMEOUT_LEDGERS` and use internal PRNG.

### dedup.json

**Purpose:** Prevents duplicate submission of randomness seeds  
**Size:** Grows with the number of unique (raffle, request_id) pairs processed  
**Persistence:** Must survive container restarts to prevent double-submissions  
**Loss impact:** If lost, requests that were successfully submitted on-chain may be re-submitted after restart, causing `RandomnessAlreadyProvided` errors on-chain.

### Volume mount configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` mounts a named volume `oracle_data` at `/app/data`:

```yaml
volumes:
  oracle_data:
    driver: local
```

This path matches the container's `WORKDIR /app` and is pre-created with `node`-user ownership in the Dockerfile (`RUN mkdir -p /app/data && chown node:node /app/data`), so the service can write state files without root privileges.

To change the location, set `DATA_DIR` in your `.env` file to the desired absolute or relative path and update the volume mount target in `docker-compose.yml` to match. For Kubernetes deployments, mount a persistent volume claim at the same path.

## Health and Metrics Endpoints

| Endpoint       | Purpose                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`  | Liveness probe — returns `{"status":"ok"}`                                                                          |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text exposition format; requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured |

Health defaults to port `9090` (`HEALTH_PORT`). Metrics default to port `9091`
(`METRICS_PORT`) and bind to `127.0.0.1` (`METRICS_BIND_ADDRESS`). Compose does
not publish the metrics port to the host. To scrape from another container,
bind metrics to `0.0.0.0`, configure a strong `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN`, and connect
to `oracle:9091` on the Compose network. Configuration rejects a non-loopback
metrics bind without a token.

The health endpoint is published only on host loopback as
`http://localhost:9090`; Docker's health check continues to call it inside the
container.

## Metrics Reference

| Metric                            | Type      | Labels    | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `oracle_requests_observed_total`  | Counter   | `raffle`  | `RandomnessRequested` events enqueued for this oracle             |
| `oracle_request_latency_seconds`  | Histogram | —         | Wall time from event observation to confirmed on-chain submission |
| `oracle_submissions_total`        | Counter   | `outcome` | Submission results: `success`, `retry`, or `fatal`                |
| `oracle_queue_depth`              | Gauge     | —         | Current number of pending randomness jobs                         |
| `oracle_queue_oldest_age_seconds` | Gauge     | —         | Age of the oldest queued job in seconds                           |
| `oracle_dead_letter_total`        | Counter   | —         | Jobs permanently failed after exhausting retries                  |
| `oracle_listener_ledger_lag`      | Gauge     | —         | Ledgers between network tip and last processed checkpoint         |
| `oracle_rpc_errors_total`         | Counter   | `kind`    | RPC errors by phase: `poll`, `simulate`, `send`                   |
| `oracle_fees_spent_stroops_total` | Counter   | —         | Cumulative transaction fees paid for submissions                  |

## Suggested Alert Rules

These mirror the thresholds in `.env.example` and the existing webhook alerter.

### Queue depth

```yaml
- alert: OracleQueueDepthHigh
  expr: oracle_queue_depth > 10
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: Oracle request queue depth exceeds limit
```

Env: `ALERT_QUEUE_DEPTH_LIMIT=10`

### Queue age

```yaml
- alert: OracleQueueAgeHigh
  expr: oracle_queue_oldest_age_seconds > 300
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: Oldest queued randomness request is stale
```

Env: `ALERT_QUEUE_AGE_LIMIT_MS=300000` (300 seconds)

### RPC unreachable

```yaml
- alert: OracleRpcUnreachable
  expr: increase(oracle_rpc_errors_total{kind="poll"}[5m]) >= 3
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: Oracle cannot reach Soroban RPC
```

Env: `ALERT_RPC_UNREACHABLE_THRESHOLD=3`

### Submission failures

```yaml
- alert: OracleSubmissionFailures
  expr: increase(oracle_submissions_total{outcome="fatal"}[10m]) > 0
  for: 0m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: Oracle failed to submit provide_randomness
```

Env: `ALERT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3` (consecutive failures before webhook alert)

### Listener lag

```yaml
- alert: OracleListenerLag
  expr: oracle_listener_ledger_lag > 50
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: Oracle event listener is falling behind chain tip
```

### Fee burn rate

```yaml
- alert: OracleFeeBurnHigh
  expr: rate(oracle_fees_spent_stroops_total[1h]) > 1000000
  for: 15m
  labels:
    severity: info
  annotations:
    summary: Oracle transaction fee spend rate is elevated
```

## Crash-safety and Deduplication

### Failure windows

1. Crash before checkpointing ledger: events may be re-processed after restart; deduplication must prevent double-submission.
2. Crash after submission but before persisting dedup record: submission may succeed on-chain but the off-chain store not reflect it (risk of duplicate submission after restart).
3. Crash between enqueue and submission: a job may be lost if it was only in-memory and not checkpointed.

### Current design

- `ledger-checkpoint` persists the last processed ledger to `data/checkpoint.json`.
- `DeduplicationStore` persists seen requests to `data/dedup.json` and provides duplicate detection.
- The service marks a request as seen after successful submission to avoid false-positive filtering.

### Tradeoffs and mitigation

- Marking deduplication _after_ successful submission avoids lost requests, but introduces a tiny window where a crash after on-chain success but before persistence could lead to duplicate submission.
- The dedup store is written synchronously to disk on each check.
- The ledger checkpoint ensures we don't skip events silently.

## Log schema

The oracle emits structured JSON logs (via `pino`). In development, logs are formatted with `pino-pretty` for readability.

### Common fields

| Field      | Type   | Description                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `level`    | number | Pino log level (10=debug, 30=warn, 50=error) |
| `msg`      | string | Human-readable log message                   |
| `time`     | string | ISO-8601 timestamp                           |
| `pid`      | number | Process ID                                   |
| `hostname` | string | Machine hostname                             |

### Request-correlation fields

When processing a randomness request, logs are emitted from a child logger bound with:

| Field       | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requestId` | BigInt string of the on-chain `RandomnessRequested` `request_id` |
| `raffleId`  | Soroban contract ID of the raffle                                |

These fields allow you to `grep` a single `requestId` across listener → queue → VRF → submission.

### Example log lines

**Production (JSON):**

```json
{"level":30,"time":"2026-08-29T08:00:00.000Z","pid":1234,"hostname":"oracle-1","msg":"Enqueuing randomness request","requestId":"42","raffleContract":"CABC...","timestamp":"1234567890"}
{"level":30,"time":"2026-08-29T08:00:01.000Z","pid":1234,"hostname":"oracle-1","requestId":"42","raffleId":"CABC...","msg":"Successfully submitted provide_randomness: abc123..."}
```

**Development (pretty):**

```
[2026-08-29 08:00:00.000 +0000] WARN: Enqueuing randomness request requestId=42 raffleId=CABC...
[2026-08-29 08:00:01.000 +0000] WARN: Successfully submitted provide_randomness: abc123... requestId=42 raffleId=CABC...
```

### Secrets redaction

The logger redacts the following from any log message:

- `ORACLE_SECRET_KEY`, `secretKey`, `secret`, `password`, `token`, `apiKey`, `api_key`, `accessKey`, `access_key`, `privateKey`, `private_key`, `passphrase`
- Hex/base64 strings longer than 32 characters when preceded by `hex=` or `base64=`

Raw key material is **never** written to logs.

## Startup

### Prerequisites

The oracle service requires the following environment variables:

- `ORACLE_SECRET_KEY`: Stellar Ed25519 secret key (S... format or 32-byte hex/base64)
- `STELLAR_RPC_URL`: Soroban RPC endpoint (e.g., https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org)
- `FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID`: Stellar contract address for the raffle factory

Optional configuration:

- `DATA_DIR`: Directory for persistent state files (`checkpoint.json` and `dedup.json`). Resolved to an absolute path at startup. In Docker this is the `oracle_data` named volume mounted at `/app/data`. **If this directory is not persisted across restarts the oracle resumes from the current ledger and will miss any `RandomnessRequested` events that arrived while it was down.** (default: `./data`)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`; default: `info`)
- `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`: Event polling interval in milliseconds (default: 5000)
- `HEALTH_PORT`: Port for `/health` and `/metrics` (default: 9090)
- `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`: Webhook URL for operational alerts
- `ALERT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`: Consecutive failures before alerting (default: 3)
- `ALERT_RATE_LIMIT_MS`: Minimum time between alerts (default: 60000)
- `ALERT_QUEUE_DEPTH_LIMIT`: Queue depth alert threshold (default: 10)
- `ALERT_QUEUE_AGE_LIMIT_MS`: Queue age alert threshold (default: 300000)
- `ALERT_RPC_UNREACHABLE_THRESHOLD`: RPC unreachable alert threshold (default: 3)
- `ORACLE_RETRY_BASE_MS`: Retry backoff base in milliseconds (default: 500)
- `ORACLE_RETRY_MAX_MS`: Maximum retry backoff in milliseconds (default: 30000)
- `ORACLE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`: Maximum submission attempts (default: 5)

### Starting the service

```bash
# From the oracle directory
npm run build
npm start
```

Or directly with Node.js:

```bash
node dist/src/index.js
```

### Expected log lines

On successful startup, you should see:

```
Starting oracle service for contracts: <FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID>
Oracle service started successfully
```

If alerts are configured and enabled:

```
Oracle service started (poll interval <POLL_INTERVAL_MS>ms)
```

If alerts are disabled (no webhook URL):

```
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL is not set; operational alerts are disabled.
```

### Runtime logs

When processing randomness requests:

```
Successfully submitted provide_randomness: <tx_hash> for raffle=<contract> requestId=<id>
```

When skipping duplicates:

```
Skipping duplicate request: raffle=<contract> requestId=<id>
```

### Shutdown

On graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM):

```
Shutting down oracle service...
Received SIGTERM — starting graceful shutdown.
Draining <n> in-flight job(s) before shutdown.
Job drained: raffle=<contract> requestId=<id>
Checkpoint persisted at ledger <n>.
Graceful shutdown complete. Exiting 0.
```

If shutdown timeout is exceeded:

```
Graceful shutdown drain exceeded 30000 ms — forcing exit 1.
```

## Randomness sources

In single-oracle mode, the oracle signs a message bound to the raffle contract and request ID. The seed submitted on-chain is the first 8 bytes of SHA-256 of that signature proof, interpreted as a big-endian u64; the on-chain verifier independently derives the same value. The wall clock is not a source of seed entropy.

In quorum mode, each participating oracle generates its seed from 8 bytes returned by Node.js `crypto.randomBytes`.

## Pipeline components

The oracle service wires the following components:

1. **KeyService**: Manages the oracle's Ed25519 keypair for signing
2. **EventListenerService**: Polls Soroban RPC for RandomnessRequested events
3. **RequestQueue**: Queues jobs for processing with health monitoring
4. **DeduplicationStore**: Prevents duplicate submissions
5. **VrfService**: Generates VRF proofs for randomness
6. **TxSubmitterService**: Submits provide_randomness transactions with retry logic
7. **GracefulShutdown**: Drains in-flight jobs before exit

## Data persistence

The service creates two data files in the `./data` directory:

- `checkpoint.json`: Last processed ledger number
- `dedup.json`: Set of processed (raffle_contract, request_id) pairs

Ensure the `./data` directory is writable by the service process.
