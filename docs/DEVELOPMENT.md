# Development Guide

This guide covers the repository workflow. The current checkout is part of a
build-repair and hardening pass, so commands and feature descriptions below do
not imply that the workspace currently compiles.

## Prerequisites

- Rust and `rustup` (toolchain version pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Stellar CLI `23.4.1` — must match `STELLAR_CLI_VERSION` in `scripts/common.sh`
- Node.js 20 or newer for `oracle/`

The correct WASM target (`wasm32v1-none`) and Rust toolchain channel are declared
in `rust-toolchain.toml` and picked up automatically by `rustup`.

## Local Checks

Before opening a pull request, run the full CI suite with a single command:

```bash
make ci
```

This mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exactly: orphan check, formatting,
contract build, WASM size gate, docs sync, clippy, tests, doc-tests,
shellcheck, and the complete oracle pipeline. If `make ci` is green, CI will
be green.

Individual targets are also available when you want a faster focused check:

```bash
make fmt-check      # cargo fmt --all -- --check
make clippy         # cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
make test           # cargo test --workspace
make test-doc       # cargo test --workspace --doc
make build          # stellar contract build  (wasm32v1-none)
make orphan-check   # python3 scripts/check_orphan_modules.py
make wasm-size      # python3 scripts/check_wasm_sizes.py
make docs-errors    # regenerate + git diff docs/ERRORS.md
make docs-events    # regenerate + git diff docs/EVENTS.md
make shellcheck     # shellcheck scripts/*.sh
```

This single command covers: orphan-module check, formatting, compile check,
contract build, WASM size gate, docs sync, clippy, tests, doc tests, shellcheck,
and the full oracle pipeline (format, lint, typecheck, tests).

For faster, focused iteration during development:

```bash
make oracle-fmt-check   # Prettier formatting check
make oracle-lint        # ESLint
make oracle-typecheck   # TypeScript compile check
make oracle-test-ci     # Jest tests (CI mode, with coverage)
```

The workspace currently has known build issues, so record any failure and
consult the relevant issue before claiming a green build. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
for the test layout and [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) for common environment and toolchain
problems. Do not treat stale implementation plans or status notes as evidence
that a feature works.

## Build Targets

The two contract packages are `raffle-factory` and `raffle-instance`. Contracts
are built with the Stellar CLI, which targets `wasm32v1-none` — the same target
the deploy scripts use (issue #841):

```bash
make build
```

Or to build individual packages:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release -p raffle-factory
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release -p raffle-instance
```

Deployment and verification instructions are maintained in
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). Storage tiers and TTL policy are maintained in
[STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md).

## Contribution Conventions

Use a descriptive branch prefix such as `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `test/`, or
`chore/`. Keep pull requests focused, document externally visible changes, and
update the relevant document in this directory rather than adding a temporary
root-level status or plan file.

See the root [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution and
review process.
